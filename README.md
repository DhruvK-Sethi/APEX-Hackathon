## Getting Started
1. Install Flask: Flask is a Python web framework and can be installed using pip by running `pip install flask`.
2. Create a new directory for your project: This can be done through the terminal or command line.
3. Initialize a virtual environment: This is an optional step but recommended for isolating the dependencies of your project from other projects on your system. You can initialize a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv` in your project directory.
4. Activate the virtual environment: You can activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS or on Windows.
5. Clone the Github repository onto your system: Use the following command in the terminal to clone the repository: `git clone 'url'`.
6. Install Required Packages: Run the following command in your terminal to install the required packages for the Flask server: `pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy numpy pandas openpyxl geopy`.
7. Navigate to the Main File: In the Command Prompt, navigate to the "main.py" file using the Python scripting format.
8. Launch the Flask Server. Ctrl click on the localhost link provided by the Flask server to access the webpage.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
